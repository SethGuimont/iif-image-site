# iif-image-site

I selected this project because I found it fascinating that 
These images were available for this purpose.  

If I want to quickly stand up a website on my local machine, I 
use node.js with the express package installed to quick set up a local server.

For styling the site, I rely on "https://themewagon.com/"
to spark my creativity and save time while making the site responsive
(able to use on multiple devices). I could also use the bootstrap node 
module, but this is the way I am most used to.

Once I found the images I wanted to use, I used the element inspector to retrieve the proper
Url

As I come from a QA background, I wanted to add a test in the using selenium
so that way that framework is ready if we need any extra validation of 
correct data.
