# iif-image-site

I selected this project because I found it fascinating that 
These images were available for this purpose.  

If I want to quickly stand up a website on my local machine, I 
use node.js with the express package installed to quick set up a local server.  


I did not take a long amount of time styling the site, but I did want to use some general
Responsive features.  I used a bootstrap file from a "themewagon.com" template called photographer and
used "https://fontawesome.com" to get some ready to use icons for the footer.

Once I found the images I wanted to use, I used the element inspector to retrieve the proper
Url.

As I come from a QA background, I wanted to add a test in the using selenium
so that way that framework is ready if we need any extra validation of 
correct data.  

To host the site locally, use the command "node server.js", then open a web browser to "localhost:3001".

To run the automated test, enter "node test.js".
