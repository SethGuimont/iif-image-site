# iif-image-site

I selected this project because I found it fascinating how easy it was to utilize these images
on another site.  

If I want to quickly stand up a website on my local machine, I 
use node.js with the express package installed to quickly set up a local server.  


The site did not take long to style, but I did want to use some general
responsive features.  I used a bootstrap file from a "themewagon.com" template called photographer and
"https://fontawesome.com" to get ready to use icons for the footer.

Once I found the images I wanted to use, I used the element inspector to retrieve the proper
url.

As I come from a QA background, I wanted to add a selenium test. That way if we need any automated testing
in the future it is easy to implement. 

To host the site locally, use the command "node server.js", then open a web browser to "localhost:3001".

To run the automated test, enter "node test.js".
